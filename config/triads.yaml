# Triad Definitions for SenseMaker Feedback Application
#
# This file defines the triangular signifiers (triads) that users place their stories on.
# Each triad has three vertices with positive descriptors. Users place their story somewhere
# within the triangle based on how their experience relates to these three dimensions.
#
# Configuration format:
# - version: Config file format version
# - context: The domain/context for which these triads are designed
# - triads: List of triad definitions
#   - id: Unique identifier for the triad
#   - name: Display name for the triad
#   - description: What aspect of the experience this triad captures
#   - vertices: Exactly 3 vertices, each with:
#     - id: Unique identifier within the triad
#     - label: Short display label
#     - description: Longer explanation of what this vertex represents
